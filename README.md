# AT51 Libfind Results - Linux Firmware

This repository contains the results of the `at51` command's `libfind` subcommand output on all linux-firmware blobs that cpu_rec identifies as 8051. Also contains the script I wrote to generate the results.  Requires the `LIB` directory from the Keil 8051 toolchain which is only available under license from KEIL.  This toolchain is available after registration with SiliconLabs' `Simplicity Studio`.
